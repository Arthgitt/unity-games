# 🎮 Arth's Unity Game Collection

Welcome to my collection of games — all created and developed by me using **Unity**.  

I originally started making games as a **hobby**, and over time, I began to **enjoy the entire process deeply**. The journey is often incredibly **frustrating**, but my **curiosity** keeps me going until the end — and seeing the finished product always feels **worth every second spent**.  

When I started, it took me about a **week** to learn Unity and build my first-ever game, **Pi-Piper**. Since then, I’ve grown a lot — improving with every project.  
Now, what once took me a week, I can make in **just 2–3 days**, even for 3D games. 🚀

Hey, so in this game,

If they catch you, you’re done.

Step into the world of **Midnight Parcel Delivery**, a 3D adventure where you play as a mysterious night courier trapped in a haunted town.  
Your mission is to **collect three magical parcels** in each level and **escape through a portal door** — all while surviving supernatural enemies lurking in the shadows.

#### 👻 Enemies
- **Ghost Enemy**: Patrols around parcels and chases you if you get too close. If it touches you twice, you lose.  
- **Balloon Enemy**: Moves **only when you move** — like a mirror. Stay unpredictable or you’ll be caught.

#### ⚡ Dynamic Difficulty  
With each level, the **enemy speed increases**, making the game more intense and challenging.  

#### 🎯 Goal  
Collect all **3 parcels**, avoid enemies, and reach the **portal** before it’s too late.  
Good luck, courier — you’ll need it.
